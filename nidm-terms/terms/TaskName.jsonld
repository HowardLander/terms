  "description": "REQUIRED. Name of the task (for resting state use the \"rest\" prefix). No two tasks should have the same name. Task label is derived from this field by removing all non alphanumeric ([a-zA-Z0-9]) characters. Note this does not have to be a \"behavioral task\" that subjects perform, but can reflect some information about the conditions present when the data was acquired (e.g., \"rest\", \"sleep\", or \"seizure\").",
