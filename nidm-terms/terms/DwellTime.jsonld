  "description": "RECOMMENDED. Actual dwell time (in seconds) of the receiver per point in the readout direction, including any oversampling. For Siemens, this corresponds to DICOM field (0019,1018) (in ns). This value is necessary for the optional readout distortion correction of anatomicals in the HCP Pipelines. It also usefully provides a handle on the readout bandwidth, which isn\u2019t captured in the other metadata tags. Not to be confused with\u00a0EffectiveEchoSpacing, and the frequent mislabeling of echo spacing (which is spacing in the phase encoding direction) as \"dwell time\" (which is spacing in the readout direction).",
