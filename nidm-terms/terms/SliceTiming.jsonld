  "description": "RECOMMENDED. The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times (in JSON format) containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the\u00a0SliceTiming\u00a0field, it is important to check if the OPTIONAL\u00a0SliceEncodingDirection\u00a0exists. In particular, if\u00a0SliceEncodingDirection\u00a0is negative, the entries in\u00a0SliceTiming\u00a0are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis (i.e., the final entry in the\u00a0SliceTiming\u00a0list is the time of acquisition of slice 0). This parameter is REQUIRED for sparse sequences that do not have the\u00a0DelayTimefield set. In addition without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible.",
