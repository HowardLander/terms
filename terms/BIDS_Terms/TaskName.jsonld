Task label is derived from this field by removing all non alphanumeric ([a-zA-Z0-9]) characters. Note this does not have to be a \"behavioral task\" that subjects perform, but can reflect some information about the conditions present when the data was acquired (e.g., \"rest\", \"sleep\", or \"seizure\").",
