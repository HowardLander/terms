  "description": "RECOMMENDED. The \"effective\" sampling interval, specified in seconds, between lines in the phase-encoding direction, defined based on the size of the reconstructed image in the phase direction. It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as \"dwell time\" (see\u00a0DwellTime\u00a0parameter below for actual dwell time). It is required for unwarping distortions using field maps. Note that beyond just in-plane acceleration, a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding need to be accounted for properly, including partial fourier, phase oversampling, phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.2This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present.",
