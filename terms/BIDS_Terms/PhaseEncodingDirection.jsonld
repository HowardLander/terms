  "description": "RECOMMENDED. Possible values:\u00a0i,\u00a0j,\u00a0k,\u00a0i-,\u00a0j-,\u00a0k-. The letters\u00a0i,\u00a0j,\u00a0kcorrespond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIFTI file. The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum index unless\u00a0-\u00a0sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from the highest index instead of zero).\u00a0PhaseEncodingDirection\u00a0is defined as the direction along which phase is was modulated which may result in visible distortions. Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term\u00a0InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection\u00a0which can have\u00a0ROW\u00a0or\u00a0COL\u00a0values. This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present or when using multiple runs with different phase encoding directions (which can be later used for field inhomogeneity correction).",
