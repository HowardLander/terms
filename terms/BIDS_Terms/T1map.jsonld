  "comment": "This is related to nidm:0000052, which is nidm:Map, in NIDM-Results, but is unrelated to nidm:ContrastMap since the contrast in that case is related to fMRI condition contrasts, rather than an NMR physics-related concept.  It is related to nidm:ParameterEstimateMap from NIDM-Results in the sense that calculation of a parameter map from a set of images in which the contrast is changed by modifying an acquisition parameter related to a parameter of interest (in this case T1), is an estimate of a parameter resulting from the fitting of image data on a pixel-by-pixel basis.",
