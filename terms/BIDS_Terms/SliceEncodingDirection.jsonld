Possible values:\u00a0i,\u00a0j,\u00a0k,\u00a0i-,\u00a0j-,\u00a0k-\u00a0(the axis of the NIfTI data along which slices were acquired, and the direction in which\u00a0SliceTiming\u00a0is defined with respect to).\u00a0i,\u00a0j,\u00a0k\u00a0identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIfTI file. A\u00a0-\u00a0sign indicates that the contents of\u00a0SliceTiming\u00a0are defined in reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds to the slice with the largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice index zero. When present, the axis defined by\u00a0SliceEncodingDirection\u00a0needs to be consistent with the \u2018slice_dim\u2019 field in the NIfTI header. When absent, the entries in\u00a0SliceTiming\u00a0must be in the order of increasing slice index as defined by the NIfTI header.",
