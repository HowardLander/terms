  "description": "RECOMMENDED. Number of volumes (\"dummy scans\") discarded by the scanner (as opposed to those discarded by the user post hoc) before saving the imaging file. For example, a sequence that automatically discards the first 4 volumes before saving would have this field as 4. A sequence that doesn't discard dummy scans would have this set to 0. Please note that the onsets recorded in the _event.tsv file should always refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding imaging file - independent of the value of\u00a0NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner\u00a0field.",
