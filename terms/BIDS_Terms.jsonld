In particular, if SliceEncodingDirection is negative, the entries in SliceTiming are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis (i.e., the final entry in the SliceTiming list is the time of acquisition of slice 0).

Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).",

As an example, for Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually, but rather in pre-defined selectable groups of individual channels, and the list of the groups of elements that are active/selected in any given scan populates the Coil String entry in Siemens\u2019 private DICOM fields (e.g., HEA;HEP for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated). This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to define the active coil elements. Since individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected, it is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM for each individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking that a given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected",

However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).",

Slice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times (in JSON format) containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the SliceTiming field, it is important to check if the OPTIONAL SliceEncodingDirection exists. In particular, if SliceEncodingDirection is negative, the entries in SliceTiming are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis (i.e., the final entry in the SliceTiming list is the time of acquisition of slice 0). This parameter is REQUIRED for sparse sequences that do not have the DelayTimefield set. In addition without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible.",

However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).",

        "Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a longitudinal study. In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session. However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).",

The vendor-defined terminology for active coil elements can go in this field. As an example, for Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually, but rather in pre-defined selectable groups of individual channels, and the list of the groups of elements that are active/selected in any given scan populates the Coil String entry in Siemens\u2019 private DICOM fields (e.g., HEA;HEP for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated). This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to define the active coil elements. Since individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected, it is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM for each individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking that a given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected",

        "Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a longitudinal study. In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session. However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).",

        "Session can (but doesn't have to) be synonymous to a visit in a longitudinal study. In general, subjects will stay in the scanner during one session. However, for example, if a subject has to leave the scanner room and then be re-positioned on the scanner bed, the set of MRI acquisitions will still be considered as a session and match sessions acquired in other subjects. Similarly, in situations where different data types are obtained over several visits (for example fMRI on one day followed by DWI the day after) those can be grouped in one session. Defining multiple sessions is appropriate when several identical or similar data acquisitions are planned and performed on all -or most- subjects, often in the case of some intervention between sessions (e.g., training).",

As an example, for Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually, but rather in pre-defined selectable groups of individual channels, and the list of the groups of elements that are active/selected in any given scan populates the Coil String entry in Siemens\u2019 private DICOM fields (e.g., HEA;HEP for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated). This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to define the active coil elements. Since individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected, it is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM for each individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking that a given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected",

This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to define the active coil elements.
