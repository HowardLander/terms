Conceptually, such individuals want to make sure they are correct when they give a response. Higher values of Beta reflect this response style. The emphasis is on avoiding commission errors. Other individuals respond more freely to make sure they respond to most or all targets, and they tend to be less concerned about mistakenly responding to a non-target. Lower values of Beta are produced by this response style)",
