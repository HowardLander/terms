  "description": "Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CPT II) - Hit Reaction Time Variability T-score (Like Overall Standard Error, the Variability of Standard Error is a measure of response speed consistency. However, Variability of Standard Error measures 'within respondent' variability. That is, the amount of variability the individual shows in 18 separate segments of the test in relation to his or her own overall standard error. Although Variability of Standard Error is a different measure than Overall Standard Error, typically the two measures produce comparable results. The higher the Variability of Standard Error, the greater the inconsistency in the response speed)",
