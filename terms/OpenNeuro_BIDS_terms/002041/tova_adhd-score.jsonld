An ADHD score of -1.80 or less (more negative) fits the profile of the ADHD sample. A score of more than -1.80 (more positive) does not fit the ADHD profile. When comparing ADHD scores (such as with medication challenges), the higher the ADHD score the better the performance. Thus, the ADHD score can be used as an indicator of response to treatment)",
