## Project Description
### THE NEUROIMAGING DATA MODEL: FAIR DESCRIPTORS OF BRAIN INITIATIVE IMAGING EXPERIMENTS NIH RF1 MH120021

Reuse of existing neuroscience data relies, in part, on our ability to understand the experimental design and study data. Historically, a description of the experiment is provided in textual documents, which are often difficult to search, lack the details necessary for data reuse, and are hampered by differences in terminologies across related fields of neuroscience. Our vision is to build on existing resources to create annotation and discovery tools that are based on a metadata standard expressive enough to provide unambiguous descriptions of the experimental methods and metadata. In this proposal, we develop the Experiment component of the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM-E), a metadata format leveraging techniques from the semantic web, capable of precisely describing information about the design and intent of an experiment, experimental subject characteristics, and the acquired data. The deliverables of this project focus on developing the terminologies to support NIDM-E and description of BRAIN datasets.
